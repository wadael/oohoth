# OOHOTH

This is not about an object-oriented ice planet.
OOHOTH is the acronym for "on one hand, on the other hand".

Its goal is to generate a text that you can then tweet. 
For those of you who can do 280 chars 

This code 
````

ohohoh = OOHOTH("Many many people swore to protect country from inside enemies",
                "There is no 46 yet, despite everything that is taped")
ohohoh.generate(20, 20)
ohohoh.print()
````

will generate this text

````

I just needed to create something in Python to use what I learned.
Clean code far from guaranteed.
